### Tools and Libraries Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- React Router: Used for routing to navigate between different components.
- React Toastify: Displays notifications for user feedback, such as success and error messages.

### Challenges Faced and Decisions Made

- Routing Structure: Implementing seamless navigation with react-router-dom was essential for a smooth user experience.
- Notification Management: Decided to use react-toastify to handle notifications, as it provided customizable and non-intrusive alerts for errors and success messages, improving user engagement and feedback.
