This is the frontend part of the project, built using React and related libraries to create an interactive, user-friendly interface.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SahilGhadiya/TodoApp.git
   cd frontend

   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install

   ```

3. Configure Environment Variables: Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add the following

### Tools and Libraries Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- React Router: Used for routing to navigate between different components.
- React Toastify: Displays notifications for user feedback, such as success and error messages.

### Challenges Faced and Decisions Made

- Routing Structure: Implementing seamless navigation with react-router-dom was essential for a smooth user experience.
- Notification Management: Decided to use react-toastify to handle notifications, as it provided customizable and non-intrusive alerts for errors and success messages, improving user engagement and feedback.
